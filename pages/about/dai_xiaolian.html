<h1>Dai Xiaolian - Artistic Consultant</h1>

<p>
Dai Xiaolian (戴晓莲) was born in Shanghai and started to study the art of guqin playing from an early age, under the tutelage of her granduncle, the renowned guqin master Zhang Ziqian from the Guangling School. Thus her guqin playing was very much grounded in the essence of his teaching. Later on she also received guidance from several guqin masters including Wu Jinglue, Wu Wenguang, Yao Bingyan, Gong Yi, Lin Youren, and Cheng Gongliang. Upon graduating from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music in 1985, she took on the post of associate professor of Chinese Music and supervisor of the Master’s Program at the conservatory.

Dai Xiaolian inherited the rich foundation of the traditional qin study, absorbing the best from various schools of teaching and is one of the foremost exponents of the traditional Chinese art of guqin. At the same time, she is also at the cutting edge of new music, active in the contemporary music scene, performing at numerous art festivals and concerts, and collaborating with many renowned musicians, composers, and orchestras, both in China and abroad. Her unique style of qin playing embodies the flowing and lucid manner of Guangling style combined with her own style and touch. Her interpretation of music pieces is deeply intellectual and elegant. She can play both fast and slow pieces with rigor and grace, applying sophisticated treatment befitting each.
